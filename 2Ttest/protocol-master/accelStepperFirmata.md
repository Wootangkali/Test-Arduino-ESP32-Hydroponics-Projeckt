AccelStepperFirmata (Stepper 2.0)
===

Provides support for full 2 wire, full 3 wire, full 4 wire, half 3 wire, and half 4 wire stepper motor drivers (H-bridge, darlington array, etc) as well as step + direction drivers such as the [EasyDriver](http://www.schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/).
Current implementation supports 10 stepper motors at the same time (#[0-9]).

Includes optional support for acceleration and deceleration of the motor.

Also includes multiStepper support which allows groups of steppers to be simultaneously controlled. Up to five multiStepper groups can be created. The total number of steppers is still limited to 10.

AccelStepperFirmata sends and receives floats in a custom format described at the end
of this document.

Example files:
 * ConfigurableFirmata [AccelStepperFirmata.cpp](https://github.com/firmata/ConfigurableFirmata/blob/master/src/AccelStepperFirmata.cpp).

Added in Firmata protocol version 2.6.0.

**Stepper zero**

accelStepper will store the current absolute position of the stepper motor (in steps). Sending the zero command will reset the position value to zero without moving the stepper.

```

**Stepper step (relative move)**

**Stepper to (absolute move)**

Moves a stepper to a desired position based on the number of steps from the zero position.
Position is specified as a 32-bit signed long.

```

```

**Stepper enable**

For stepper motor controllers that are configured with an enable pin, the enable command manages whether the controller passes voltage through to the motor. When a stepper motor is idle, voltage is still being consumed so if the stepper motor does not need to hold its position use enable to save power.

```

If acceleration is on (non-zero) sets the maximum speed in steps per second. 
The speed value is passed using accelStepperFirmata's custom float format described below.

**MultiStepper configuration**

Stepper instances that have been created with the stepper configuration command above can be added to a multiStepper group. Groups can be sent a list of devices/positions in a single command and their movements will be coordinated to begin and end simultaneously. Note that multiStepper does not support acceleration or deceleration.

**MultiStepper to**

Sets each stepper in a group to a desired position based on the number of
steps from its zero position. Positions are specified as a 32-bit signed long.

Stepper movements will be coordinated so that all arrive at their desired
position simultaneously. The duration of this move is based on which stepper
will take the longest given the change in position and the stepper's max speed.

AccelStepperFirmata's Custom Float Format
---

Floats sent and received by accelStepperFirmata are composed of a 23-bit significand (mantissa)
and a 4-bit, base 10 exponent (biased -11 with an explicit 1's bit) and a sign bit.

|0-20                  |21   |22-25   |26-27   
|----------------------|-----|--------|---------------------
|least significant bits|sign |exponent|most significant bits 
|21 bits               |1 bit|4 bits  |2 bits

These values allow a range from 8.388608*10^-11 to 83886.08. Small enough to represent one step per year and large enough to exceed our max achievable stepper speed.

**Example 1: 1 step per hour**

1 step per hour = 1 step / 60 minutes / 60 seconds = 0.000277... steps per second

The largest integer that can be represented in 23 bits is 8388608 so the
significand will be limited to 6 or 7 digits. In this case 2777777 (note the value truncates).

The exponent is 4 bits which limits the range to 0-15, but we subtract
11 from that value on the receiving end to give us a range from -11 to 4. In
this example we are passing 1 to give us a -10 value in the exponent.

|            | Decimal| Binary                 |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
|Significand | 2777777| 01010100110001010110001|
|Exponent    |       1|                    0001|
|Sign        |       0|                       0|



Values in firmata are passed in the 7 least significant bits of each message byte
so we will be passing in 4 bytes in this order:

|                                           | Binary  | Hex |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|-----|
| Least most significant bits               |  0110001| 0x31|
| Next most significant bits                |  1000101| 0x45|
| Next most significant bits                |  0101001| 0x29|
| Sign, Exponent and 2 most significant bits|  0000101| 0x05|

**Example 2: 100 steps per second**

We have to pad our significand on the right with four zeros to get our full
precision. That makes the significand 100000000 and our exponent value will be 2.
Since the value we send will be biased -11 on the receiving end, we send 13 in
the exponent.

|            | Decimal| Binary                 |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
|Significand |       1| 00000000000000000000001|
|Exponent    |      13|                    1101|
|Sign        |       0|                       0|

Values in firmata are passed in the 7 least significant bits of each message byte
so we would be passing in 4 bytes in this order:

|                                           | Binary  | Hex |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|-----|
| Least most significant bits               |  0000001| 0x01|
| Next most significant bits                |  0000000| 0x00|
| Next most significant bits                |  0000000| 0x00|
| Sign, Exponent and 2 most significant bits|  0110100| 0x34|
